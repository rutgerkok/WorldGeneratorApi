## Bug reports
A good bug report is actionable - it makes it clear what I need to do. So "it doesn't work" isn't really helpful, but "version 1.2 prints out errors (see attachment) when generating custom ores" is. So please try to be as specific as possible.

## Feature requests
You can always request a feature. Whether I will implement it, depends on how much I like the feature, how much time I have and how complex the feature is. Of course, you can always try to implement the feature yourself. :smile:

## Pull requests
Pull requests (code contributions) are greatly appreciated. I try to accept all pull requests. However, there is always a chance that I need to reject a pull request, for example if feature doesn't fit within the scope of WorldGeneratorApi.

## Any questions?
If you have a question, feel free to open an issue. You can also send me an e-mail - the address is on my Github profile.
